## Our Mini Jam Submission
A game where a dragon controls a kite to catch fish-birds out of the sky!

# Birding: Dragon Valley Kiting
 
Use your kite to catch fish-birds from the depths of Dragon Valley to outer space!

# Controls
Press spacebar to launch your kite.
Move your kite with WASD.
Catch fish-birds by hovering your kite over them.
Press spacebar again to land your kite.

# Theme
The theme of Mini Jam 153 was Fishing and the limitation was No Water. We decided birding would be a good alternative to fishing since there is no water. So we made a game where you can bird.
